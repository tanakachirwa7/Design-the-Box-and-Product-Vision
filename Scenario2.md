# Scenario: Reviewing Business Performance for Decision-Making

Maria is preparing for a quarterly planning meeting where she needs to discuss sales trends and inventory performance. She opens the latest report generated by the data analytics pipeline.

The report includes clear charts showing revenue trends, top-performing products, and regions with declining sales. A written summary highlights key insights and potential concerns. Because the reports follow a consistent format each week, Maria quickly understands the information without needing to ask technical questions.

During the meeting, Maria confidently references the data to support decisions about inventory restocking and marketing strategies. She trusts the accuracy of the report because it is generated automatically through a standardized pipeline, reducing the risk of human error.
