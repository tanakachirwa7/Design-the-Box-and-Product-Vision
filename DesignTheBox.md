## Product Name
DataFlow Analytics Pipeline

## Tagline
Clean data in, clear insights out.

## Product Overview (What’s on the Box)
DataFlow Analytics Pipeline is a data processing system that ingests raw data, cleans and transforms it through a structured pipeline, and produces meaningful analytical reports. The system is designed using a Pipes and Filters architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## Key Features (Highlights on the Box)
- Automated data cleaning
- Modular data transformation stages
- Scalable pipeline architecture
- Report generation and export
- Support for multiple data formats

## Detailed Feature Description (Back of the Box)

### Automated Data Cleaning
The system removes duplicates, handles missing values, and corrects formatting issues in raw datasets before analysis begins.

### Modular Data Transformation
Data passes through independent filters that perform transformations such as normalization, aggregation, and enrichment. Each filter operates independently and can be replaced or extended.

### Pipes and Filters Architecture
Each processing stage is connected by data pipes, allowing smooth data flow and supporting concurrent execution of filters.

### Report Generation
Processed data is formatted into readable analytical reports, such as summaries and statistics, which can be exported for further use.

### Multi-Format Support
The pipeline supports structured data formats such as CSV and JSON, allowing flexibility in data sources.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Accept raw data as input
- Clean and preprocess data
- Apply transformation filters
- Generate analytical reports
- Output results in a readable format

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Modular and maintainable design
- Scalable to handle large datasets
- Reliable data processing
- Easy to extend with new filters

## Logo (Optional)
The logo could represent a flowing pipeline with data blocks moving through connected stages, symbolizing transformation and analysis.
