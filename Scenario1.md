# Scenario: Preparing Weekly Sales Reports

Alex arrives at work on Monday morning knowing he needs to deliver updated weekly sales reports to the management team by the afternoon. The raw data comes from multiple sources: a CSV export from the sales system, an API providing online order data, and a database containing historical records.

Using the data analytics pipeline, Alex uploads the new data sources and starts the automated cleaning process. The system identifies missing values and inconsistent date formats and applies predefined transformation rules. When an error appears in one dataset, the pipeline clearly explains the issue, allowing Alex to quickly fix the source file and rerun the process.

Once the data is cleaned and merged, the pipeline generates summary statistics and visual reports. Alex reviews the outputs, confirms they match expectations, and exports the final report. He sends it to Maria and the rest of the management team on time, without having to manually clean data for hours.
